# Insurance Premium Prediction

ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Regression Project â€“ Kaggle Submission

This project builds a regression model to predict insurance premium amounts using a real-world dataset of 2 million entries. The goal was to optimize model performance while maintaining interpretability and memory efficiency under resource constraints.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- Trained a Random Forest model on 2M records with custom preprocessing and feature engineering
- Applied tailored imputation strategies for missing values and encoded high-cardinality categorical features
- Achieved ~1.15 RMSE on Kaggle's private leaderboard
- Visualized distribution patterns and evaluated prediction errors to understand model limitations

## ðŸ“ˆ Tools & Libraries

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (exploratory analysis and training)

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics

- ðŸ“‰ RMSE: ~1.15 (Kaggle)
- ðŸ“‰ MAE: ~637
- ðŸ“ˆ Records Used: 2,000,000+

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Due to file size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.

Please download it directly from the Kaggle competition page:
